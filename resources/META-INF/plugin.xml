<p><b>Run a bash shell command on the selected lines.</b>
Execute a bash process that pipes the selected lines as if they were an input file, same as <b>stdin</b>, through a custom bash shell command. The output from the process replaces the selection with <b>stderr</b> and <b>stdout</b>. Works with multiple carets by piping each selection region separately into their own process. Also works with no carets.</p>
<p><b>General usage instructions</b>
Invoke with <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd>, or by selecting text and right-click the editor to show the context menu. The menu item is called <b>Pipe selected text to bash</b>. When no lines are selected, use the keyboard shortcut to open the bash argument window.</p>
<p><b>Demo</b>

<p><b>Features</b>
<ul><li>Remembers the last command arguments</li><li>Treats output containing either stderr and stdout the same</li><li>Works with multiple carets, 1 caret and no carets</li><li>Bug-free on Linux and Windows</li><li>Actively supported - <a href="https://github.com/profbear/pipeprofen/issues"> open an issue on github</a></li><li>Unlicensed, free public domain source</li></ul></p>
<p><b>Note:</b> you must have bash in your operating system environment's PATH.</p>
<p>Being able to run anything in the editor and change the buffer text was heavily inspired by emacs's lisp expressions <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Eval.html#Lisp-Eval">(eval-last-sexp), (eval-defun) and (eval-expression)</a>. This plugin is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the antiquated Shell Process plugin.</p>]]></description>
