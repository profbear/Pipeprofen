<p>Runs the selected lines in the editor through a custom bash
shell command and inserts the value into the editor's
selection region. Replaces lines with the output (stderr and
stdout) from the process. Works with multiple carets by
piping each selection region separately into their own process.
</p>

<p>Invoke with
<kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd>,
or by selecting text and right-click the editor to show the
context menu. The menu item is called "Pipe selected text bash".</p>

<p>If no lines are selected, use the keyboard shortcut to open
the bash argument window.
</p>

<p>Note that you must have bash in your environment's PATH.</p>

<p>Being able to run anything in the editor and change the text
was inspired by
<a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Eval.html#Lisp-Eval">
emacs's lisp eval-last-sexp.
