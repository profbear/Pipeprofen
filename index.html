<p><b>Run a bash shell command on the selected lines.</b></p>

<p>
  Execute a bash process that pipes the selected lines as
  if they were an input file, same as <b>stdin</b>, through
  a custom bash shell command. The output from the process
  replaces the selection with <b>stderr</b> and <b>stdout</b>.
  Works with multiple carets by piping each selection region
  separately into their own process. Also works with no carets.
</p>

<p>
  <b>General usage instructions</b>
  <br>
  Invoke with
  <kbd>ctrl</kbd>-<kbd>alt</kbd>-<kbd>shift</kbd>-<kbd>x</kbd>,
  or by selecting text and right-click the editor to show
  the context menu. The menu item is called <b>Pipe selected
  text to bash</b>.
  When no lines are selected, use the keyboard shortcut to open
  the bash argument window.

<p>
  Being able to run anything in the editor and change the buffer text
  was heavily inspired by emacs's lisp expressions
  <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/Lisp-Eval.html#Lisp-Eval">
    (eval-last-sexp), (eval-defun) and (eval-expression)</a>. This
  plugin is intended to be a drop-in replacement for the
  antiquated Shell Process plugin.
</p>

<p>Please, let me know if this works for you in Windows.</p>
